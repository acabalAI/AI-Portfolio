# Alberto Caballero - AI Specialist

## Introduction

Welcome to my AI project portfolio, where I explore the fascinating world of Artificial Intelligence and its potential to enhance human life. I am Alberto Caballero, a passionate AI professional with a strong academic foundation and a track record of delivering innovative AI solutions. My journey in AI has led me to work on diverse projects, including multinational initiatives and the development of conversational agents for Qigong practitioners and Job Interview simulators as well as AI-based negotiation tools and Narratives Detection system in Social Media.

- **LLM-FineTuning**: A deep dive into Large Language Models (LLMs) and fine-tuning techniques to enhance their performance for specific tasks.
- **RLHF-Toxicity**: Experimentation with Reinforcement Learning from Human Feedback (RLHF) to create less toxic content, aligning AI outputs with human values and ethical standards.
- **Qigong-Assistant**: In collaboration with the shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine and the Institute of Qigong Research of Shanghai we are developing a multilingual AI-based assistant for international practicioners of Qigong, the progress of the project was published and share in a Conference in October 2023.
- **Political News Intention Detection**: In this project part of my [Master Thesis](assets/documents/TFM_CaballeroHinojosaAlberto.pdf) we explore the relevance of detecting Political news intentions and how we can implement effective systems through LLMs for such end, the projec is an on-going endevour that has cristallized into a PhD research project at UNED-NLP research center.
- **Fake Jobs prediction and Topic Modelling**: Exploration of advanced topic modeling techniques to uncover latent themes within textual datasets.
- **Job Interview Similation-bot**: In this project we develop a Simulation bot with a dinamic dialogue manager to guide and provide feed-back to job seekers.
- **AI-based Narratives Detection System**: System to detect Narratives in Social Media Contest, the proposed system obtained the best result in the DIPROMATS 24 competition.

- **Cognitive AI**: Replicate Human congitive processes using the latest AI technology to improve scalability and transparency of systems.

## Portfolio Projects

### **LLM-FineTuning**

In the LLM-FineTuning project, I delve into the world of Large Language Models (LLMs) and explore fine-tuning techniques. This project showcases how LLMs can be harnessed to address specific tasks, enhancing their performance and utility.


### **RLHF-Toxicity**

In this project, I experimented with RLHF to create less toxic content. RLHF plays a vital role in controlling the output from LLMs, aligning it with human values and ethical standards. By implementing this project, we can gain further insight into how RLHF can help us tame the power of LLMs within more humanistic and ethical frameworks.

### **Qigong-Assistant**:

In collaboration with the University of Traditional Chinese Medicine of Shanghai and the Institute of Qigong Research of Shanghai we are developing a multilingual AI-based assistant for international practisioners of Qigong, the progress of the project was published and share in a Conference in October 2023.
This project is currently under progress, the conference paper and the results shared at an international conference are available in the folder.


### **Political News Intention Detection**: 
[![https://github.com/acabalAI/News-Intentions](/assets/img/images.jpeg)](https://github.com/acabalAI/News-Intentions)

In this project part of my Master Thesis we explore the relevance of detecting Political news intentions and how we can implement effective systems through LLMs for such end, the projec is an on-going endevour that has cristallized into a PhD research project at UNED-NLP of UNED university in Spain.
Both the thesis and its presentation are available within the folder documents.

### **Fake Jobs prediction and Topic Modelling**

## Professional Contributions

### Multinational Projects

Throughout my AI journey, I have had the privilege of contributing to multinational projects, enriching my understanding of AI's global impact and its diverse challenges. I have worked with companies such as Santander Bank, Prosegur, Hainan Airlines, Telefonica, and more.

### Conversational Agents for Qigong Practitioners

One of my most exciting projects involved developing conversational agents for Qigong practitioners. This initiative showcased the versatility of AI and its potential to improve health and well-being.

### Political News Intention Detection

In collaboration with the UNED-NLP project, we are developing an innovative approach to automatically detect intention in political news. This contributes to information verification and decision-making for citizens and users of social media.
